# Welcome to **"Choose A Bottle of Wine"**

What an awesome flow chart!

***


The purpose of the project was to find some real-life problem/case that could be solved by 
breaking it down into a set of rules; thus, giving a user an opportunity to answer 
a sequence of questions, which will lead to a precise and distinct solution. 
	
I wanted to do something interesting. While surfing the Internet I ran into this great flowchart. 
The main idea is how to pick the right bottle of wine. I didnâ€™t implement all of the possible combinations; however, the 
amount of work that I did was enough to give me a good idea of how to use and construct rule-based
applications, based on forward chaining logic.

The project was written in a Clips, Forward Chaining Rule-Based System.
